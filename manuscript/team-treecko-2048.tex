\begin{abstract}
This short paper describes the method used to evolve a controller for the game \emph{2048} for the GECCO 2015 competition. A generic Linear Genetic Programming open-source tool is used to directly write a Java class, that is subsequently corrected, compiled inside the provided framework, and run to obtain a fitness value.
\end{abstract}

\section{$\mu$GP}
The evolutionary core used in this experience is $\mu$GP (or MicroGP) \cite{Squillero2005}, a generic open-source evolutionary tool hosted on SourceForge\footnote{\url{http://ugp3.sourceforge.net/}}. As individuals in this framework are internally encoded as directed multi-graphs, $\mu$GP technically belongs to the family of Linear Genetic Programming \cite{}. The software is chosen for several desirable features: self-adapting parameters; customizable structure of the individual genome, specified by an XML file; design that makes it possible to use parallel, external fitness evaluation.

Thanks to the user-customizable and richly expressive structure of the genome, $\mu$GP is successfully used in different applications concerning automatic code generation, ranging from the design of AIs in the game \emph{Core Wars}\footnote{For more information, see \url{http://www.corewars.org/}} \cite{Corno2005}, to the generation of Assembly-language code for processor's stress tests \cite{Corno2003}, %from the evolution of configurations in wireless sensor networks \cite{Bucur2014}, 
to the generation of C++ classes for AIs in StarCraft \cite{Garcia2015}.

\section{Proposed Approach}
The approach used in the competition relies upon exploiting $\mu$GP to directly write valid Java classes for the controller, modifying the code with a script to take into account some possible issues, compiling the generated class in the provided framework, and finally executing the resulting \texttt{jar} to obtain the fitness values.

\subsection{Genome structure}
In previous applications of $\mu$GP, the presence of \emph{jump}-like structures in the target language (such as \texttt{goto}s in C/C++ and \texttt{jmp} in Assembly) proved to be particularly beneficial to the evolutionary algorithm. In Java, by design, there is no such structure: in order to obtain a similar behavior, the main part of the genome describes a \texttt{for} loop that contains a \texttt{switch...case} statement, with a non-fixed number of \texttt{case}s. The variable that drives the loop is also used in the \texttt{switch}, and its value can be changed by the statements themselves. This rather complex structure factually behaves like a series of \texttt{goto}s, leaving the evolutionary algorithm free to branch over multiple conditions. An example of the generated code is reported in Figure \ref{fig:codeblock}.

\section{Experimental results}
The experiments are run until a stagnation condition is reached. The settings for $\mu$GP are reported in Table \ref{table:settings}.

In $\mu$GP, every time a mutation is applied on an individual, it is executed again, unless a randomly generated number in $(0,1)$ is higher than the current value of $\sigma$: this parameter is self-adapted during the evolution, trying to find a good balance between exploration (many mutations) and exploitation (few mutations). Self-adapting of parameters is regulated by $\alpha$, following the formula:

\begin{equation}
\texttt{new\_value} = \alpha \cdot \texttt{old\_value} + (1 - \alpha) \cdot \texttt{target\_value}
\end{equation}
